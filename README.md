# Smart-Trafficlight-Project

During this project we are going to make a smart traffic light system. The smart traffic light 
system will be able to detect a pedestrian or a car is waiting at a traffic
light, and control the lights accordingly. We decided to make this partially as a quality of
life innovation, but it will also help those who have trouble pressing the button at a traffic
light, for example blind people. This should overall improve safety and increase the accuracy
of traffic lights as the traffic lights will be able to judge the environment and situation by
themselves and control the lights in an appropriate manner.
